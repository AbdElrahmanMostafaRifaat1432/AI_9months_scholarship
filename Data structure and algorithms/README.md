# Data structure and algorithms Implementations
 this repository contains implementations of some of the most used algorithms such as
 double linked list with search , update , delete , insert , count Nodes
 implementation of stack and queue using double linked list
 merge sort and max_min algorithm using recursion as a divide and conquer algorithm
 implementation of a graph and applying Depth first and Breadth first to print the nodes in the right traverse order
