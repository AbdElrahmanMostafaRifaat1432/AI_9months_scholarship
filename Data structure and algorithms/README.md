# Data structure and algorithms Implementations
 1 - this repository contains implementations of some of the most used algorithms such as
 2 - double linked list with search , update , delete , insert , count Nodes
 3 - implementation of stack and queue using double linked list
 4 - merge sort and max_min algorithm using recursion as a divide and conquer algorithm
 5 - implementation of a graph and applying Depth first and Breadth first to print the nodes in the right traverse order
