0-make a function to read a file of words and choose a word randomly
input: None
output: word

1-make a function to take an input from the user

the function must make sure that the entered letter wasn't entered before (whether right or wrong)
so it takes history of entered letters as argument 
and return the new entered letter after adding it to the history
note: the function never exits until it takes a new letter, also if a user enters more than 1 letter it will take only the first character
input: history_list
output: letter


2-make a function that checks if the entered letter is in the word or not
so it takes the letter and the word as arguments
returns True or False
(using lambda function)

input: letter, word
output: True or false


3-make a function that hides the word but only show correct entered letters

eg. if word is 'banana' it should be ______
if the user entered 'a', it becomes _a_a_a

the function takes the word and the correctly entered list
input: word, correct_list
output: hidden word


you will need 

history_list: for all entered letters
correct_list: for correctly entered letters
tries: number of tries allowed (start with 6 and decrease with every wrong guess) (game over at tries = 0 or when the word is guessed correctly)
